# You Are a 1337 H4X0R

Sometimes you hack on things and you need to hold a vote to see who is the most 1337. You can hold that vote on this thing.

## Running This App Locally (To Hack on it of course)

Clone it down. Add RVM or RBENV (whichever floats your boat). Make sure you're on at least 1.9 since I like the new hash syntax and I'm forcing it on you. Bundle install it. Run rackup.

## Deploying This App

This thing can be deployed to Heroku pretty easily. Get a new app. Install postgres and you're basically done.

## Are you a Bad Enough Dude(tte) to Add These Features?

* Taking back votes
* Adding validation for missing names, emails, etc.
* Authentication and proper access control (maybe you have a Hackday master who runs the app and then people just vote on stuff)
* Adding RABL. Cuz RABL is cool.
* Various other rad things

## Post-amble...
